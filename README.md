# EpiCell-IQ
EpiCell-IQ is a lightweight R-based tool designed for predicting the originating cell composition (OCC) from methylome data. This tool is particularly optimized for sparse methylation data from Nanopore sequencing but is versatile enough to work with array- and sequencing-based references, making it ideal for identifying the tissue of origin in liquid biopsy applications, including cancer detection.
### Features
- **Flexible reference datasets:** It supports both array- and sequencing-based methylation references, ensuring adaptability to different experimental setups.
